# Pellegrino

An aimless attempt at building a PC from scratch, in a vaguely eurorack/modular synth style.

## Software

The intended software for the Pellegrino PC is the MnemOS Operating system, a small general purpose operating system.

More information on MnemOS is located in [the firmware folder](./firmware/README.md).
