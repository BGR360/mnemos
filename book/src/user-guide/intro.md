# Users Guide

This chapter contains information relevant to users of a MnemOS based computer.

For development information see the [Developers Guide Chapter](../dev-guide/intro.md).

> # ⚠️ **NOTE**
>
> If you are getting started as a user, you will *probably* need to at least initially flash the MnemOS kernel to your device. At the moment, no device ships with the MnemOS kernel pre-loaded.
>
> For now, please refer to the [Developers Guide](../dev-guide/intro.md) for information and software/hardware required, and necessary steps to do this.
>
> Once you have finished flashing the kernel, you can move on to the rest of this section.
