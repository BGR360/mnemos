# MnemOS Userspace Library

This Rust library (or crate) serves as the primary interface for userspace applications to the services provided by the kernel.

It contains a couple of important things:


* An `entry` function declaration
* Linker Scripts
* Library code

For more information, refer to the [Userspace Component](https://mnemos.jamesmunns.com/components/userspace.html) chapter of the MnemOS book.
