# Filling algorithm

The input FIFO can hold 2048 bytes.

This means 512 stereo samples. This is 11.6ms worth of data.

At 8MHz, this will take 2.048ms to fill.

DREQ really only tells us if there is room for 32 more bytes.

I should probably do something like:

```rust
#[task]
fn audio(cx: audio::Context) {
    // Bytes sent in this payload
    let mut sent = 0;

    if app_said_go() {
        let used = send_header();
        sent += used;
    }

    // Could take up to 2ms to fill. Then we'll generally spend 1ms
    // filling every 5.8ms.
    //
    // TODO: If I could be smarter about estimating the amount of data
    // to fill, we could instead do this in a non-blocking way, for at least
    // some of the time. Maybe let it drain down to 1/4 of the capacity,
    // auto-fill 1/2 of the capacity, then blocking fill the rest.
    //
    // OR, if we could use a GPIO request to halt/pause the transfer.
    // Hmm.
    //
    // Annoyingly, an interrupt every 32 bytes would only be 11609
    // cycles, which would be a lot of interrupts. We could slow down
    // the clock rate, but this would block the bus for other things.
    let stop = loop {
        if dreq.is_low() {
            dreq_stop = true;
            break Reason::Dreq;
        }

        let data = if let Some(data) = pop_max(32) {
            sent += data.len();
            // TODO, blocking? should take 32us
            spi.send(&data);
        } else {
            empty_stop = true;
            break Reason::Empty;
        }
    };

    // Schedule the next drain
    let us = match stop {
        Reason::Dreq => {
            // The buffer is full. Schedule the next
            // fill time for 1/2 the play time for
            // the samples to play.

            // TODO: if we let it drain down to 64 samples (256 bytes),
            // We could do a batch send of 1792 bytes.
            5_800
        }
        Reason::Empty => {
            if app_said_stop() {
                // just return without rescheduling
                return;
            }
            // We ran out of samples, schedule something in the
            // future, not TOO fast so the app has time to fill
            // the buffer up again. We should probably let the
            // app say "go".
            (bytes_to_play_time_us(sent) / 2).min(SOME_MIN_VALUE)
        }
    };

    audio.schedule_after(us.micros());
}
```
