# Day One

* I should probably break up common:
    * "porcelain" goes to move to "mnemos-std"
    * common just becomes the "syscall ICD" crate
* I should probably make "kernel" a library, rather than an application
    * This would work towards having separate hardware support
    * Progressive step towards this would be to move more of the "kernel" bits into the lib.rs
