Okay, I realized that the whole kind of setup is weird now.

I initially thought I had two ways to signal that a future is done:

* Mark the status flag in the FutureBox
* Send a notification back on the ring buffer

But that seems redundant.

* If I JUST use the status flags, the userspace executor needs some way to awake a task. Otherwise it needs to poll all the idle tasks to see if they are ready. This isn't THAT big of a deal, but it seems a little wasteful
* If I use the ringbuffer, I introduce some amount of delay, and some overhead, because the userspace has to parse the incoming messages

I shouldn't call the wakers from kernel space, because that's user controlled code.

Maybe:

* The kernel uses the buffer
* When it's done, it drops/releases the exclusive handle
* It sends a notification back (future addr? waker ptr?)

Let's look at how the code for this might look.

```rust
// Provide a "weak" entry point, that initializes the executor and calls "main".
// This way users can either use the provided one (basically if they are using
// Rust + async/await), or use their own.
//
// I guess this would also initialize the ring buffers and whatever else is expected
// on a normal startup.
//
// In this case, `main` is spawned as the "root task" in the executor
use mstd::alloc::String;

async fn main() -> Result<(), ()> {
    // This creates a future that:
    // * sends a syscall request to open the port
    //   * This doesn't really need a heap allocation, unless "everything is a future".
    //   * Even if it does require a heap allocation for the future, it doesn't need any payload.
    //     The index will be sent along (as owned data) in the request.
    // * The executor waits for a response that this has been done, OR it just polls the future?
    //   This is still an open question.
    //
    // I guess either way, when the future completes, it needs to "wake" the main task.
    //
    // TODO: Should this return a "serial handle"? Should there be an error if the serial port has
    // already been opened, or should we allow multiple handles to the same serial port?
    let mut serial_1 = mstd::serial::open(1).await?;

    // This creates a new String, with no contents. It allocates, so we need to await.
    // TODO: Should I make the "default" string/vec type Copy on Write to reduce space
    // usage?
    let mut data_buf: String = String::with_capacity(32).await;

    // Note: We can't re-alloc in the write trait, which is why we need to use "with_capacity"
    // TODO: Can this be fixed/worked around later? Probably not unless MnemOS gets the ability
    // to run threads as well...
    write!(&mut data_buf, "Hello {}, Serial World!\r\n", 123)?;

    // This actually has two parts:
    //
    // 1. `serial_1.send(data_buf).await` creates (and awaits) a future that waits
    //    for the syscall to be transferred to the kernel
    // 2. It returns a future that doesn't complete until the SERIAL SEND is complete
    //    which will happen at some later time
    //
    // The latter handle can be dropped, and the send will still happen.
    let sent_hdl = serial_1.send(data_buf).await;

    // This actually ensures the data was sent successfully
    sent_hdl.await?;
}
```

Jeez.

Lots of stuff going on.

Okay, I'm going to have an executor that is global - or at least the spawner or something is going to be global

```rust
#[no_mangle]
unsafe fn entry() -> ! {
    // Initialize the ringbuffers. The pointers are located in a fixed memory location
    let rb = init_ringbuffers();

    // Initialize Heap - This data will either be stored at a fixed memory location, or
    // will be the first message received from the ring buffer. Not sure yet.
    let heap = init_heap();

    // This comes from user code
    extern "Rust" {
        async fn main() -> Result<(), ()>;
    }

    // Initialize and take the "worker" non-global half of the executor. Initialize it
    // with the "root" task and other singleton bits
    let mut exec_hdl = init_executor(
        main,
        rb,
        heap,
    );

    // This loops interenally until the program ends, I guess?
    exec_hdl.run();

    // TODO: I probably need some unsafe method for yeeting the current grant
    // in bbqueue, and maybe some way of hard-halting the executor.
    panic!();
}
```

I think I'm going to end up having "global" public bits, like the spawner, and private singleton bits that really only exist in the main function above. The singletons are probably fine to be unsafe.

So what do the futures look like?

In the example above, I have:

1. serial open
2. string allocation
3. send string to serial port
4. wait for string to be sent

Let's mock those out.

```rust
// 1 - serial open
mod serial {
    struct SerialHdl {
        port: u16,
    }

    async fn open(port: u16) -> Result<SerialHdl, ()> {
        // TODO: Probably make some macro-op to handle this, to ensure that we are listening before we
        // send, and to "hide" the ID and stuff from the caller. Something like:
        // `fn(SysCallReq) -> RbRxFut`
        let id = executor::next_id();
        let request = SysCallReqPacket {
            id,
            msg: SysCallReq::Serial(SerialRequest::Open(port))
        };
        let rx: RbRxFut = ringbuf.register_rx(id).await;
        let tx: RbTxFut = ringbuf.send(request);
        tx.await;
        // end macro-op

        match rx.await? {
            SysCallResp::Serial(SerialResp::Opened) => Ok(SerialHdl { port }),
            _ => Err(())
        }
    }
}
